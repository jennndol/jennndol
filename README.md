Ever since I was in senior high school, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of the Pentium III computer in my bedroom, writing a computer program that printed "Hello, World!" in PASCAL for the very first time. As I went through the tutorial, it was almost a magic. Being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, started with 'begin' and ended with 'end' syntax and limited only by imagination.

Now in industry, this passion remains with me. There's undoubtedly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
