Ever since I was in senior high school, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of the Pentium III computer in my bedroom, writing a computer program that printed "Hello, World!" in PASCAL for the first time. As I went through the tutorial, it was almost magic. Getting the computer to do whatever I wanted, started with 'begin' and ended with 'end' syntax and was limited only by imagination.

Now in the industry, this passion remains with me. There's undoubtedly yet more to learn, problems to solve, and more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
